### **Deploy a WordPress Website on AWS EC2**

**1. Create an EC2 Instance**
   - Go to the AWS EC2 dashboard.
   - Click "Launch Instance," select "Ubuntu" as the OS.
   - Choose instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`).
   - Create and download a new SSH key pair.
   - Configure network settings to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
   - Launch the instance.

**2. Assign an Elastic IP Address**
   - Allocate and associate an Elastic IP to ensure your instance has a static IP.

**3. Connect to Your EC2 Instance**
   - Use an SSH client (e.g., MobaXterm) with your private key to connect to the instance.

**4. Install Apache Web Server**
   - Run `sudo apt install apache2`.
   - Verify installation by accessing your instance’s IP address.

**5. Install PHP and MySQL**
   - Install PHP and MySQL with `sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php mysql-server`.
   - Configure MySQL for WordPress by setting up a database and user.

**6. Install WordPress**
   - Download WordPress using `wget` and unzip it.
   - Move WordPress files to `/var/www/html`.
   - Visit your instance’s IP with `/wordpress` to complete the setup.
   - Create a `wp-config.php` file if prompted.

**7. Configure Apache for Root Directory**
   - Edit Apache’s configuration (`/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`) to set the document root to `/var/www/html/wordpress`.
   - Restart Apache with `sudo systemctl restart apache2`.

**8. Assign a Domain Name**
   - Update DNS settings to point your domain to your Elastic IP.
   - Modify Apache config to recognize your domain and subdomain.

**9. Secure Your Website with HTTPS**
   - Install Certbot using `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache`.
   - Obtain an SSL certificate with `sudo certbot --apache`.

**10. Verify HTTPS and Domain**
   - Ensure your site is accessible via HTTPS.
   - Update WordPress settings to use your domain name.

**Additional Tips**
   - Use strong passwords.
   - Regularly update WordPress and plugins.
